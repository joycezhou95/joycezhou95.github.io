				<div class='paragraph'>Hello world! My name is Joyce. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley. I will be graduating in the spring of 2017 with a Cognitive Science major and a Computer Science minor. <br>
				<br>
				Relevant coursework: Introduction to Cognitive Science, Psychology of Perception, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Data Structures, Machine Structures, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs <br>
				<br>
				In my free time I enjoy expressing myself through dance and drinking boba with good company.

				<div class='paragraph'>I went to Valley Christian High School (VCHS) and graduated in 2013. I graduated in the top 9% of my class with a weighted academic GPA of 4.40.<br>
				<br>
				In Fall of 2013 I started at UC Berkeley. At Berkeley, I started my education in computer science and cognitive science. I have taken four computer science courses and two cognitive science classes. Through Berkeley, I learned many computer science languages including but not limited to Python, Java, C, assembly code, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>

				<div class='paragraph'>I started developing my artistic skills through traditional mediums. At first I focused solely on graphite still life drawings. As I become more comfortable with graphite, I started painting, specifically watercolor. Afterwards I branched out to many different mediums, specializing specifically in graphite and ink.<br>
				<br>
				In my AP 2D Design high school class, I started learning more digital mediums like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I refined my Photoshop skills when I joined the high school robotics team as the graphic design lead. As the graphic designer, I had to create marketing fliers and banners to promote the team and the functions of the robot.<br>
				<br>
				I have continued to create fliers in college and branched out to creating apparel for various teams. I have also started learning more about typography and creating typographic collages.<br>

				<div class='paragraph-header' >PERSONAL</div>
				<div class='paragraph'>Growing up, one of my biggest passions (and time commitments) was gymnastics. I competed throughout the nation up until I was a level 9 gymnast. I quit gymnastics going into sophomore year of high school due to injuries, but picked up dance shortly after quitting. I've stuck with dance ever since and I hope to have a long future with dance. I first started training in Jazz/Contemporary styles but going into college I started learning hip hop choreography.<br>
